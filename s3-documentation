AWS S3
Used for backup and storage of data
Allows to store files called objects in directories called buckets
Buckets are defined in a region level
Objects have a key which is the full path to the object 
Max object size is 5TB, If uploading more than 5Th, use multi-part upload
   
Security - json based policies
      
1. User based 
IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM

2. Resource based
Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules, can be assigned from the s3 console. 
  Eg: Makes a s3 bucket public, allows cross account access
Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain security (can be disabled)
Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - can be disabled

An IAM principal can access an s3 object if the user IAM permission allows it or the resource policy allows it and there is no explicit denial.

Static Website Hosting
S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the Internet.

Versioning
You can version the files in S3. The settings has to be enabled in bucket level. Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version null.
