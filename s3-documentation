AWS S3
Used for backup and storage of data
Allows to store files called objects in directories called buckets
Buckets are defined in a region level
Objects have a key which is the full path to the object 
Max object size is 5 GB, If uploading more than 5 GB, use multi-part upload
   
Security - json based policies:
      
1. User based 
IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM

2. Resource based
Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules, can be assigned from the s3 console. 
  Eg: Makes a s3 bucket public, allows cross account access
Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain security (can be disabled)
Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - can be disabled

An IAM principal can access an s3 object if the user IAM permission allows it or the resource policy allows it and there is no explicit denial.

Static Website Hosting:
S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the Internet.

Versioning:
You can version the files in S3. The settings has to be enabled in bucket level. Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version null.

Replication: 
Asynchronous replication of data from source bucket to destination bucket. Buckets can be in different AWS accounts.
CRR - Cross Region Replication: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
SRR - Same Region Replication: log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts
To enable replication, we need to first enable versioning in source and destination bucket.

After you enable replication, only new objects are replicated. You can replicate existing objects using S3 batch replication. It replicates existing objects and objects that failed replication.
There is no chaining in replication. If bucket1 has replication into bucket2, which has replication into bucket3. Then objects created in bucket1 are not replicated to bucket3.
For delete operations: Can replicate delete markers from source to target (optional setting).

Steps to Enable S3 Replication:
To enable S3 replication, follow these key steps:

1. Enable Versioning: Both the source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled.
2. Set Up a Replication Rule: Define the replication rules to specify which objects to replicate and how (including the destination bucket and storage class).
3. IAM Role for S3 Replication: You need an IAM role that allows Amazon S3 to replicate objects on your behalf.


S3 storage classes
1. Standard - General Purpose
2. Standard - Infrequent Access IA
3. One zone - Infrequent Access
4. Glacier Instant Retrieval
5. Glacier Flexible Retrieval
6. Glacier Deep Archive
7. Intelligent Tiering

Can move between classes manually or using s3 lifecycle configurations

1. S3 Standard
- Use Case: Frequently accessed data
- Cost: Highest among the classes due to availability and performance
- Availability: 99.99%
- Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)
- Performance: Low latency and high throughput
- Redundancy: Replicated across multiple Availability Zones (AZs)
- Features: Ideal for dynamic content, websites, data analytics, and cloud applications where data is accessed frequently. Big data analytics, mobile and gaming applications
  
2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- Use Case: Data with unknown or unpredictable access patterns
- Cost: Slightly higher than Standard for frequent access, but reduces costs by automatically moving infrequent access data to cheaper tiers
- Availability: 99.9% (for infrequent access objects), 99.99% (for frequent access objects)
- Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)
- Performance: Similar to S3 Standard for frequently accessed data, slightly higher retrieval time for infrequent data
- Redundancy: Multi-AZ replication
- Features: Moves data between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent) automatically based on usage patterns without any performance impact or retrieval fees.

3. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
- Use Case: Infrequently accessed data that needs rapid access when required
- Cost: Lower storage costs compared to Standard but with retrieval costs
- Availability: 99.9%
- Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)
- Performance: Similar to Standard but with retrieval fees
- Redundancy: Multi-AZ replication
- Features: Suitable for long-term storage of data that is accessed less frequently but requires immediate access when needed (e.g., backups, disaster recovery data).

4. S3 One Zone-IA (One Zone-Infrequent Access)
- Use Case: Data that is infrequently accessed and can tolerate a single Availability Zone failure
- Cost: Lower than Standard-IA because it stores data in only one AZ
- Availability: 99.5%
- Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s) in a single AZ
- Performance: Similar to Standard-IA
- Redundancy: Single-AZ replication (no multi-AZ)
- Features: Ideal for data that does not need the resilience provided by multiple Availability Zones, such as secondary backups or data easily recreated.

5. S3 Glacier
- Use Case: Long-term archival storage where access is infrequent and retrieval time is flexible
- Cost: Very low storage cost, with additional costs for retrieval
- Availability: 99.99%
- Min storage duration of 90 days.- Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)
- Retrieval Options: Standard (3-5 hours), Expedited (1-5 minutes), Bulk (5-12 hours)
- Redundancy: Multi-AZ replication
- Features: Suitable for archival data, backups, and long-term data retention where fast access is not critical (e.g., compliance archives).

S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval: Millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter. Min storage duration of 90 days.

6.S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- Use Case: Very long-term archival storage with very rare access requirements
- Cost: Lowest storage cost, designed for data that is rarely accessed
- Min storage duration of 180 days.
- Availability: 99.99%
- Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)
- Retrieval Options: Standard (12 hours), Bulk (up to 48 hours)
- Redundancy: Multi-AZ replication
- Features: Ideal for long-term data storage that you plan to retain for years or decades and can wait for up to 48 hours for retrieval (e.g., regulatory archives, compliance).
